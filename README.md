Greetings,

I wrote this backend as part of a larger project (food ordering website) to enhance my web development skills. It has typical classes such as the REST controller, model classes, and repository classes. To take it a bit further I added mail service and SMS service classes which serve as part of the ordering process. The customer submits an order, receives a randomly generated number for validation, and after validation receives an email receipt of the order. 

If you wish to use this backend please be sure to update the missing credentials in the application.properties file.
